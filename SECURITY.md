# Security

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you believe you've found a security vulnerability in acp-traces, please report it responsibly.

**Do not** open a public GitHub issue for security-sensitive bugs.

**Instead:**

1. **Email** the maintainers (preferred): you can reach the project owner via the email listed in the commit history or on their GitHub profile.
2. **Private security advisory** on GitHub: go to [Security → Advisories](https://github.com/AndreKurait/acp-traces/security/advisories) and click **Report a vulnerability** to create a private draft. This keeps the discussion confidential until a fix is ready.

Include:

- A short description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce
- Impact (e.g., data exposure, denial of service)
- Suggested fix if you have one (optional)

We will acknowledge receipt and aim to respond with an initial assessment within a few days. We may ask for more details. Once a fix is released, we can coordinate on disclosure timing (e.g., release notes, CVE) and credit you if you wish.

## Supported versions

We generally support the latest release with security fixes. If you need a patch for an older version, say so in your report.

## Security update process

- Fixes are developed in private and merged when ready.
- A new patch release is published (e.g., 0.3.1).
- Release notes and/or a security advisory will describe the issue and the fix after users have had time to upgrade.

Thank you for helping keep acp-traces and its users safe.
